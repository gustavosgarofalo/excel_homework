This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years. 

Most of the skills displayed here were learn either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

Excel is a tool that I am completely confortable utilizing, in order to produce dashboards, performing statistical analysis and managing datasets. Although is is a wonderfull tool which I love, it has its limitations when it ccomes to processing huge amounts of data. I have experienced this limitations first hand when working on a job to perform a demand forecast.

The skill displayed in this repository is EXCEL.
